          How I Became a Web Developer
        </h1>

        <p className="story-container-para">
          From the start, Iâ€™ve been deeply curious and passionate about drawing
          and colors. I wanted to create every type of drawing, every scenery,
          every bird, every sketch, every colorful canvas. Each piece I
          completed filled me with happiness and pride. Here are some of my
          creations:
        </p>

        <div className="gallery">
          {drawings.map((src, index) => (
            <div className="gallery-item" key={index}>
              <img src={src} alt={`Drawing ${index + 1}`} />
            </div>
          ))}
        </div>

        <p className="story-container-para">
          But over time, something else began to capture my attention:
          <strong> Websites</strong>. I noticed how beautiful they looked, how
          interactive they felt, and I couldnâ€™t stop wondering:
        </p>

        <ul className="story-container-list">
          <li>How are they built?</li>
          <li>How do they work?</li>
          <li>Who makes them?</li>
        </ul>

        <p className="story-container-para">
          That curiosity led me to Web Development. I started with WordPress,
          crafting simple sites I still cherish, but soon realized I wanted to
          go beyond designing and build them from scratch.
        </p>

        <p className="story-container-para">
          Thatâ€™s when I chose frontend development. When I started, I explored
          HTML tags and how they build web pages. Adding colors with CSS excited
          me, and placing my first image made me proud: <i>I made this!</i> That
          joy carried me forward.
        </p>

        <p className="story-container-portfolio-para">
          My portfolio journey mirrors my growth, reflects my skills, brand, and
          personality!!
        </p>

        <div className="gallery">
          {portfolioGallery.map((src, index) => (
            <div className="gallery-item" key={index}>
              <img src={src} alt={`Portfolio ${index + 1}`} />
            </div>
          ))}

        <p className="story-container-para">
          I love transforming ideas into interactive experiences and crafting
          digital products that come to life on the web. Knowing how hard it is
          to find opportunities without a strong portfolio, I thought: why not
          build one that helps other web developer?
